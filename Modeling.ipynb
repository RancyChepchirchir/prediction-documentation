    "# Introduction: Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the No Free Lunch Theorem, no algorithm will beat random guessing across all learning tasks. What this means in terms of machine learning is that there is no one superior algorithm that does better for every task. Therefore, to find the best model for a given task, we simply have to test out many and find which one achieves the highest generalization performance on the test set. Machine learning is a largely empirical area, and finding the best model remains a process of experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that in mind, in this notebook we will implement a number of machine learning models for the building energy prediction task. This is a supervised regression problem where we are asked to build a model to predict energy consumption based on historical energy usage and weather conditions. We will develop the models as functions that we can then evaluate across an entire range of buildings in order to find the best-performing model. Then we can select the best model for further development in the form of hyperparameter tuning. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Metric: Mean Absolute Percentage Error\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to compare models, we need a single metric that we can use to assess performance. There are many choices for regression, including the root mean squared error (RMSE). RMSE is measured in the same units as the target, but suffers from the issue that the value depends on the magnitude of the targets and therefore cannot be compared between buildings that have different energy use. To compare performance across buildings, we need a metric that normalizes the error by the magnitude of the target. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is one such metric. This performance measure has been used in previous electricity prediction studies, and can be used to compare predictions between buildings because it measures the error in terms relative the magnitude of the energy usage. The MAPE is calculated as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mbox{MAPE} = 100\\% * \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n  \\left|\\frac{y_i-\\hat{y}_i}{y_i}\\right|$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n$ is the number of observations, $y_i$ is the actual prediction for observation $i$, and $\\hat{y}_i$ is the predicted value. We will calculate both the MAPE on the training data and on the testing data in order to determine the degree of overfitting in the model. In addition to the MAPE, we can calculate the time it takes for the model to learn. Although time is not a significant consideration when massive computing power is available, it is still an interesting comparison to make. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Models to Evaluate\n",
    "\n",
    "We will evaluate the following models in this notebook. \n",

    "4. Random Forest Regression with 1000 decision trees \n",
    "5. Extra Trees Regression with 1000 decision trees\n",
    "6. AdaBoosting Regression with 1000 decision trees as the base learner\n",

    "Two other models with be evaluated in additional notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Gradient Boosting Machine\n",
    "2. Deep Fully Connected Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "We will implement each model here one at a time, and then refactor the code into functions that can be called for any building dataset. The end outcome is a series of functions, one for each model, that can take in training features, training labels, testing features, and testing labels and return the performance of the model. "

    "\n",
    "Let's read in an example dataset and preprocess the features using the function we developed earlier. This function takes in a building energy data, a number of days to use for testing, and a boolean for whether or not to scale the features. We will use 183 days (6 months) for testing and will choose to scale the features because we are using models that depend on the distance between observations to make predictions. Feature scaling is a best practice when comparing multiple algorithms so that the range of the features does not impact model performance. "

MAPE is calculated from the definition of the metric using the predicted values and the known test targets. The training and testing times are determined using the `default_timer` class from the `timeit` module. The `default_timer` automatically adjusts for operating system and provides the best timer accordingly. We will measure the wall-clock time, which is the total time to execute a program. This differs from the CPU time (also called execution time) which measures the time a CPU spent executing a specific program. Since we are mostly interested in the time out of curiosity rather than for model selection, the minor distinctions in time are not a significant concern. \n",

The choice of hyperparameters can have a siginficant affect both on the model's training and on the test performance. Much like choosing the best model is an experimental process, optimizing the hyperparameters of a selected model requires evaluating many different combinations to find the one that performs the best. This can be an extremely time and computational resource-intensive process. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this notebook, we will stick with the Scikit-Learn hyperparameters for the most part except where noted. Scikit-Learn aims to provide a set of reasonable default hyperparameters designed to get practicioners up and running with a decent model quickly. However, these hyperparameters are likely to be nowhere near optimal, and tuning them is recommended after a working system is built. If we had unlimited time, we would try out not only multiple models, but also work on optimizing the hyperparameters of each model to the problem. For now, we will stick with the default hyperparameters for comparing models and then optimize the hyperparameters of the model which performs the best. We will note that this might not be the most fair comparison because of the model dependence on hyperparameters, but it is a limitation we have to work with. (Note that for models where it is applicable, we set `n_jobs=-1` to use all available cores on the machine.\n",

    "In this notebook, we focus on implementing the algorithms rather than explaining how they work. Two extremely good resources for learning the theory of these models are An Introduction to Statistical Learning, and Hands-On Machine Learning in Python with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow. Both of these books provide the theory as well as how to implement the methods in R and Python respectively. Machine learning is only mastered through doing, and both of these books place a large emphasis on practicing the techniques described. With those considerations in mind, let's get to modeling! \n",

    "\n",
    "ElasticNet Linear Regression is a regularized version of Linear Regression. It is a mix of two popular regularization methods: Lasso Regression and Ridge Regression. The blend of these two methods is controlled by the `l1_ratio` hyperparameter with the overall amount of regularization controlled by the `alpha` hyperparameter. We will use the default values of these hyperparameters which are `l1_ratio = 0.5` and `alpha = 1.0`. Unlike ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression, which has an analytical solution, ElasticNet must be solved by coordinate descent. The equation for the parameters $\\beta$ in ElasticNet is:\n",

    "\n",
    "where $\\lambda_1$ multiplies the L1 norm of the parameters and $1 - \\lambda_1$ multiplies the L2 norm of the parameters. If $\\alpha = 0$, then ElasticNet simplifies to ordinary least squares regression with an objective function of Mean Squared Error (MSE). "

    "The AdaBoost - standing for Adaptive Boosting - algorithm is another ensemble method. However, unlike the random forest and extra trees, it is a boosting ensemble and not a bagging ensemble. The difference is that the individual learners are not trained independently, but rather sequentially, with each learner learning from the mistakes of the previous. In AdaBoost, this takes the form of re-weighting the observations the previous learner got most wrong when training the next. AdaBoost trains on a random subset of the training examples, and the training examples with greater weight are more likely to be included in the training set. This makes the examples that are more difficult - missed more often - more likely to appear in the training set. Moreover, while bagging methods simply average the predictions of each individual, boosting methods weight the predictions of each individual based on it's error rate. Better learners are given exponentially more weight in the final prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting methods can be built on any individual learner, but the most often choice is the decision tree. These decision trees are kept very small (sometimes decision trees with only one level are used which are called decision stumps) and on their own are weak learners. Weak learners perform better than random guessing, but are not very accurate. However, by adding a series of weak learners to the ensemble sequentially, the overall model is a strong classifier. Boosting is a general method that can be applied to any weak learner and AdaBoost was one of the first successful implementations. In later work, we will look at another boosting method called Gradient Boosting which is now considered more capable than AdaBoost. We will set the following hyperparameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `n_estimators=1000`: number of decision trees. This is set high because the individual learners are weak\n",
    "* `learning_rate=0.05`: the contribution of each learner to the ensemble. There is a tradeoff between `n_estimators` and the `learning_rate` with a lower learning rate complementing a higher number of weak learners.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other hyperparameters will be set at the default values. The default base learner for AdaBoost is the `DecisionTreeRegressor`. AdaBoost cannot be trained in parallel which means we cannot set the `n_jobs` training argument."
